# Work Days Missed due to Illness, Injury, or Disbaility
This dataset is from the National Center of Health Statisics, it contains data ranging from 2019-2023 regarding the the frequency of missed work due to illness, injury, or disability over the given time period

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to provide the readers with a statistical insight of the data provided from the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS). We also would like to compare this data to the number of COVID cases in NYC in the same years. From these two data sets we will calculatate a difference in proportions and determine if it is statistically signifigant. 

### Interesting Insight

We would like to point out a possible association between an increase the number of work days missed and the post-COVID era. While one may jump to the conclustion that an increase in COVID cases may be the cause for an increase in missed work days, increased awarness of disease transmission may be at play.

## Fair and Care Principles

Our main data set of number of people under 18 taking a sick day from school adheres to the FAIR principles because it is accessible, findable, and reusable. This data set is available to the public and uses language that is easily understood. It can also be reused to observe smaller groups such as race, location, age, and health insurance.

Our second data set of covid cases adheres more to the CARE principles. It focuses more on data collected for collective benefit and for the government to use to track covid. While this data set doesn't exactly capture or reflect directly on other cultures and worldviews, it can be used to draw conclusions about covid that relate to how covid is moving worldwide. This data set was collected ethically and is going to be for future use.

## Repo Structure

In this repo you can find a chart displaying Year vs. Percent of Population that meets the condition of missing 11 or more days of school/work due to injury or sickness as well as a chart displaying the number of recorded COVID cases in New York City by date.
